# Tree-Sitter Actions Parser
We are going to be building a tree-sitter parser for a custom file format.

Everything you need should be in the repo, please read `README.md` to get a better understanding of what is needed.

## Guidelines
Please do not just try to please me, I would like a partner in this work that will communicate concerns directly and clearly, and who is willing to think before they act, ask when they are confused, and have enough taste to know when and what to do.

I look forward to working with you as an equal partner and co-creator in this work and encourage you to express yourself and to not concern yourself with pleasing me in a short term sense, but rather to think about the long term goals and what will be better in the long run of the project.
